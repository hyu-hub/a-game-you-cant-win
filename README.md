# A Game You Can't Win

A psychological, meta platformer game built using JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. The game becomes more unstable, creepy, and unsettling the longer the player plays.

- **Meta Elements**: The game introduces glitches and unsettling changes as the player progresses.
- **Fourth Wall Breaking**: The game pretends to crash, displays fake error messages, and interacts with the player in unexpected ways.

## Features

- Background and platform color changes based on glitch intensity.
- Exit that moves away as the player approaches.
- Sound effects for added immersion.
